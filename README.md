# game_clicker

This is very-very OLD code (from my high-school days), and has many bugs I bet. So please, don't copy it blind, but you can use
as reference.

This was used to "drive" many (7-8) of gaming windowsess of "Line Age 2". You had to "target" each window in order, then load LUA
script and launch. Lua was making global shortcuts and was accessing targeted windowses through numbers (remember, order).

It was able to play complex scenarious in many windowses at once by 1 hotkey. 

Also it was avoiding GameGuard protection (C++ part).
